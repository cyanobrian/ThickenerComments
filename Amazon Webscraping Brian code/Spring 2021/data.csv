"Not for your infants!","This product was given by my pharmacy in place of the thickening agent that was prescribed for my aspirating 5 month old daughter.  She immediately started having severely runny BMs after being a regular clay-once-a-dayer.  Turns out this is made of modified food starch and maltodextrin.  It even notes on the container that 1 serving of 2 Tablespoons = 1/2 fruit serving.  As a thickener for an infant, it's 2Tbsp per 4-5oz bottle - 6 times a day - or 3 fruit servings....!  No wonder she had watery poos - the kind where we change her a minimum of 3x day.  It was ridiculous and completely unsuitable for an infant. Like giving way too much apple juice for constipation.  WAY too much. Also, when used for aspirating, it doesn't thicken evenly, so it really didn't do the job for aspirating as well as it gets thicker with time so it was awful trying to get the bottles to work with daycare.  I hated all 14 days we used this product and refuse to use it again. Total nightmare. I think this may be a good product for adults but most certainly not aspirating infants.","19 Jul 2012","Size: 2.25 Pound (Pack of 1) Style: 36 oz","","No","JulieN","1.0","Thick-It Original Food & Beverage Thickener, 36 oz Canister","https://www.amazon.com/Thick-It-RD26929208-36-OZ/product-reviews/B0011TUM3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=44"

"Batch was ineffective","The container I received has been working very very poorly for us - we've been using Thick It for a few months and it has been going fine until this container. I know the consistency to look for as I'm a speech language pathologist. I've been having to add at least double the usual amount to try to thicken to the right consistency. I'm finally at my wits end having added at least 2 tsp to a 1/2 oz and it is barely past a thin consistency so I'm going to the pharmacy now to buy a different batch.","26 Nov 2016","Size: 2.25 Pound (Pack of 1) Style: 36 oz","","Yes","Joseph M.

"So far so good","My wife has begun to have difficulty swallowing with several episodes of aspiration and I searched for some help in this regard. Her doctor suggested Thick-It. I was happy to find it on Amazon.com where most of my wife's needs come from. I have only used it for several days but it does seem to make swallowing liquids easier for her. So far there have been no further episodes of aspiration. It's easy to mix and use. I will comment further as our use of the product continues. One negative has been a supercilious and snide attitude of the dispensing company  TOG-OTC to a simple question I posed to them concerning the product. Otherwise, so far so good.","23 May 2014","Size: 2.25 Pound (Pack of 1) Style: 36 oz","","Yes","Galleyleo","4.0","Thick-It Original Food & Beverage Thickener, 36 oz Canister","https://www.amazon.com/Thick-It-RD26929208-36-OZ/product-reviews/B0011TUM3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=40"

"Not good if you have to pre-mix ahead of time, uses 3+ times more than Resource's Thicken Up","I was surprised at how big this container was and thought it would last a long time, but I was wrong! Compared to Resource ThickenUp Clear  by Nestle, I have to use 3+ times as much to get a nectar like consistancy in a 10oz cup. It also separates after an hour and does not mix again well and my poor son was choking/aspirating! It does say on the container ""For best results, consume within 30 minutes of mixing"" which I wish I knew before buying this huge container, but when someone has Dysphagia with liquids they tend to take smaller sips and don't always finish it within 30 minutes!!!! My son goes to an adult day program and I have to mix his drinks before hand (as they cannot because of liability) and I got a note saying that it was too thin and he was CHOKING! Not a good thing. I was pissed!!!! So I guess I'll use this at home, carefully till it's gone and will use Resource ThickenUp Clear by Nestle which can be mixed ahead of time, keeps it's consistancy and does not separate and uses 2 teaspoons for a 10 oz cup of liquid- compared to 7 teaspoons of Thick-It. I just wish it came in a bigger container. Another thing- this stuff is grainy and leaves a grainy film on cups, spoons, everything.","01 Nov 2017","Size: 2.25 Pound (Pack of 1) Style: 36 oz","","Yes","Tyler's mom","2.0","Thick-It Original Food & Beverage Thickener, 36 oz Canister","https://www.amazon.com/Thick-It-RD26929208-36-OZ/product-reviews/B0011TUM3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=31"

"thickness","This did a great job at thickening the liquid--needed even less than the recommended  teaspoonfulls. I did notice a difference in hot versus cold  liquids or the consistanancy of the liquid themselves so that at times I needed more/less of the powder.  Only negative is that if you are drinking with a meal, it does get  thicker over time  rather than keeping a consistency as the gum based products do.

"It actually works!","My wife has Alzheimer's Disease and had been coughing each night when she swallowed her pills.  I finally realized this was a symptom, not a coincidence, and found that it is quite common.  I was somewhat doubtful that Thick-It would help, and thought it likely that my wife wouldn't like the thickened drink anyway.  I was wrong on both counts!  We've been using it for a week now, and she hasn't swallowed down the wrong pipe once.  Plus, she actually seems to like the effect it has on the liquid (apple juice, in our case) and has been finishing off any extra in the cup.

"Great product and acheives its purpose","I really liked this product as it does what it says it's supposed to do. My husband needed this for he had a severely damaged esophagus and had some trouble swallowing and also had a double lung transplant about a year ago-his GI is all messed up and he is on a G/J tube. He can and has aspirated things into his lungs causing pneumonia which isn't good, this helps with keeping him from doing that. It might seem weird but I like putting this stuff into like chicken broth for example and eating it like a soup, it is completely tasteless, has no texture (not gritty, etc) You simply just keep adding however much you want/need until you accomplish the desired consistency. This is also a great product because for its size the prize is unmatched. I am unsure why but if you want to purchase this in a store you have to ask pharmacy for it, and a container this size from behind the walmart pharmacy here was around $70. So, this is easily a steal.

"It does help!","My dog has a condition called laryngeal paralysis. This is where the flaps to the windpipe don't work anymore and she could not breath. We had to have a tie back surgery to tie the flaps open just a little so she could breath. This made it hard for her to drink with out having some of the water go down the wrong pipe and she coughed and choked after every drinking. Eating was fine, just the drinking. I saw this product and im glad I did! You add a little powder to the liquid, stir it good, then let it sit for 30 seconds and it slowly thickens. You have to play around with the amount until you get the right thickness. For 4 fluid oz I use 2 table spoons but I am still playing with the amount. This has helped my dog very much. She can drink now with out it going down the wrong pipe. I tasted it just to see what I was dealing with and you don't taste a difference. Just the texture is different.  I, like another person posted would love to find an organic version, but this is truly a godsend for us.","27 Apr 2014","Size: 2.25 Pound (Pack of 1) Style: 36 oz","","Yes","DMC","5.0","Thick-It Original Food & Beverage Thickener, 36 oz Canister","https://www.amazon.com/Thick-It-RD26929208-36-OZ/product-reviews/B0011TUM3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9"

"Is helping Dad","My dad had to have a total laryngectomy about 2 years ago due to laryngeal cancer. Living in the rural south, he and my mom have to drive about 3.5 hours (one way) when it is time for that prosthetic voice apparatus to  be changed out. 7 total hours of driving and heavy, traffic in a tourist city around a busy research hospital is tough. I did that drive many times for them when he was still undergoing treatments and having surgeries. He has found that the closer he gets to needing the prosthetic changed, the more he coughs when he drinks water or other thin liquids. He describes it as ""leaking"". Also, there are time when he feels that the prosthetic shifts and presses against the back of the throat causing choking. But since the visits to have the prosthetic reinstalled or adjusted are costly and not a hop, skip and jump away, he endures the discomfort. It feels to him like the prosthetic has shifted and is allowing liquid to leak into his lungs -- and as a result, convulsive coughing ensues. So I ordered this and it helps. He is still about a week and a half away from his next appointment to be refitted and the coughing is still really bad but with the thickener, its bearable. Before, he was so miserable and bitter that he was lashing out and being exceptionally negative. (He may have also been getting dehydrated which can cause mood disturbances.) He was absolutely killing my mom. That constant crossness and lashing out can really do a number on the spouse who has had to assume the role of ""caretaker"". I mean, my Dad is not disabled, but the ordeal of cancer has changed him and he depends on her more and sometimes seems to resent her ""wholeness"". Since he got this product (only 5 days ago), he and my mom (who are both retired) have taken two nice day trips to shop and eat in cities about an hour away all in the same week. All before, he had been sitting in the house day after day saying one negative thing after the other, vegging out in front of the tv and feeding off of negative news programs. Now he's out on a ""date"" with my mom and he is even talking about getting a nice room and spending the night with my mom in Charleston when they drive down for his refitting. And my dad is usually very money conscious (i.e., cheap!) so for him, this is big. No, this product may not alleviate all swallowing problems but for a person who has been suffering from a diminished quality of life due to swallowing issues, this product can be a game changer. For my dad, it gives him some power back - a tool to add to his arsenal of things he can do to help manage his condition. I think feeling helpless is where all that excessive negativity was coming from. Wish I had known about this sooner.","18 Jan 2019","Size: 2.25 Pound (Pack of 1) Style: 36 oz","","Yes","LaLa","5.0","Thick-It Original Food & Beverage Thickener, 36 oz Canister","https://www.amazon.com/Thick-It-RD26929208-36-OZ/product-reviews/B0011TUM3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2"

"Thick it with swallow disorder","I have used Thick it for several years now. Husband has upper dysphagia (a swallow disorder) Upper Dysphagia has no cure, but you can help by using this. It will help lessen events of Aspiration Pneumonia. Dysphagia can be caused by things such as stroke, Cancer of the throat and even repeat pneumonia episodes mainly in the elderly. This product can also be used with infants and small children,  however,  NEVER give a baby or small child any new changes to his diet without a Dr's order. Thick it is tasteless. Remember that it takes an adjustment period to any patient going to a  regular liquid to a thicker consistency, so keep practicing in how much you use. A little hint: Start out a bit thicker than needed. The patient will say they aren't drinking that! Then make another small amount with a little less thickness. Make sure a cold drink is really COLD! I add ice to the drink BEFORE the thick it,  stir the ice till it's mostly melted,  then scoop out the remaining ice cube ( you DON'T want them to choke!) NOW add thick it! What a person with swallowing issues desires is a refreshing cold going down the throat. I really give it a fast hard stir till powder is well dissolved. You may add a touch of lemon to water,  a little real (or artificial if diabetic) sugar to make it a little more flavorful. My husband loves ice tea. I use the above method of making it. He has to have very close to pudding thick and uses a spoon to ""eat"" it. Swallow issues state using NO straws or sports bottles. Be sure the patient can be positioned @ 30 degree angle ( NO LAYING FLAT!!) The patient can aspirate anything if they are laying down. Just practice using patient's face drinks till you get good results in thickness needed.  Thicken applesauce, soup broth, ect. I think the 2 most difficult things to thicken are milk and coffee. A person with dysphagia will have a limited diet change. Cold cereal, things like Cole slaw,  salad ( basic foods that can choke must be avoided! Have your Dr order speech therapy. Medicare will pay for 100% for IN HOME care. Use that insurance FIRST ! Many visits to the home are allowed before they stop paying! Easier on the patient to learn swallow excercises in comfort of home.  Home health is there to also help show you tips, train you and make you confident in what you're doing. By time home health care is done,  patient will understand why the excercises, ect are so important & you (Caregiver) will be able to handle this health issue like a pro. Patience & common sense are the key!","18 Sep 2019","Size: 2.25 Pound (Pack of 1) Style: 36 oz","","Yes","Sandy Everett","5.0","Thick-It Original Food & Beverage Thickener, 36 oz Canister","https://www.amazon.com/Thick-It-RD26929208-36-OZ/product-reviews/B0011TUM3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Recommend","This is currently and has been for a long time the product of choice.  On line it’s priced competitively or slightly lower priced than some of it’s competitors.  I am able to purchase this for a couple dollars less per container locally but I like the convenience of ordering on line and having it delivered.  Locally I have to make a special trip to a particular pharmacy to purchase it. Once I place a reorder on line through Amazon, I don’t have to remember to go and buy it, it just arrives. So far the product itself is the best and most economical I’ve found.  It takes a while to thicken and seems to sometimes take longer than other times to thicken.  Most liquids, such as coffee and milk that I know I will use a consistent amount of in the next day or two, I mix up in bottles of 46-64 ozs the night before and keep in the fridge and it saves on the frustration of waiting and watching each serving to thicken. It works well in hot or cold. Seems to work exceptionally well to thicken soup bases. I will ladle a half amount of broth into soup cup or bowl and add thickener, it thickens quite fast, then I’ll add the noodles, veggies, and meat of what ever soup I’m thickening and it’s the perfect consistency every time. However, it still seems that a large amount of thickening powder is needed for everything I thicken but I have not found a better or more economical substitute so far so I continue to reorder this product.","04 Jan 2020","Size: 2.25 Pound (Pack of 1) Style: 36 oz","","Yes","Pam J.","4.0","Thick-It Original Food & Beverage Thickener, 36 oz Canister","https://www.amazon.com/Thick-It-RD26929208-36-OZ/product-reviews/B0011TUM3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Food/liquid thickener for people with swallow difficulty","This product thickens food and liquid so that people who have problem swallowing (i.e. aspiration pneumonia) can safely digest their meals. My elderly father suffered from this condition and end up in the hospital.  His speech therapist recommended this product.  Every meal my father had was mixed with this powder into honey consistency, including his drinking water. I ordered two of these large 36oz containers in anticipation of my father coming home.  Each container has clear instruction on the side of the box and a measuring spoon inside.  Unfortunately my father passed away before he could come home.  I was able to return my order without any problems.  My seller was Homeline Medical Inc.  I appreciate their quick customer service and hassle-free return.  I highly recommend this seller for their great price, fast delivery, and, of course, their great customer service! Note - signs of aspiration pneumonia are coughing and wheezing, followed by fever.  People who suffer from this condition have food/liquid going into their lungs instead of the esophagus.  This can lead to bacterial infection in the lungs (as was the case for my father).

"I use in salad dressings, sauces, frosting...","I was forced to consume this stuff in the hospital after a tracheotomy, and I thought I'd never want to see it again! However, I eventually realized something like this could come in very handy in the kitchen. My previous go-to no-cook thickener was xanthan gum, but my son HATES when I use it in anything! This *just* thickens things, without making them stretchy or slimy or lumpy. When I pack lunches, I add it to tuna & chicken salad to thicken up the lemon juice or vinegar and help keep the bread from getting soggy; I've used it to thicken up runny store-bought jam, yogurt, and cottage cheese. I use it to replace some of the mayo in creamy salad dressings and sugar in cake frosting, thereby reducing the calories. It helps stabilize whipped cream.It is the same starch used in instant pudding mixes, so you can use it to create your own recipes (with fewer artificial flavors/colors, if desired), or turn any beverage like juice, soda, iced coffee, or flavored milk (chocolate, strawberry, Ovaltine, etc) into a pudding.

I find it more convenient than regular cornstarch, which has to be dissolved in cold liquid;  if you've already added all the ingredients to your recipe but it's looking watery, you can just stir in some Thick-It without adding more liquid as you'd have to with cornstarch. In my opinion, some thickeners like cornstarch or glucomannan dull the flavor of my food, while Thick-It either doesn't have that effect or it must be much more subtle, because I don't notice a change in flavor.
