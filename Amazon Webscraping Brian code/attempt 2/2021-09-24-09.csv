8,1,no_title,"This product was given by my pharmacy in place of the thickening agent that was prescribed for my aspirating 5 month old daughter.  She immediately started having severely runny BMs after being a regular clay-once-a-dayer.  Turns out this is made of modified food starch and maltodextrin.  It even notes on the container that 1 serving of 2 Tablespoons = 1/2 fruit serving.  As a thickener for an infant, it's 2Tbsp per 4-5oz bottle - 6 times a day - or 3 fruit servings....!  No wonder she had watery poos - the kind where we change her a minimum of 3x day.  It was ridiculous and completely unsuitable for an infant. Like giving way too much apple juice for constipation.  WAY too much.Also, when used for aspirating, it doesn't thicken evenly, so it really didn't do the job for aspirating as well as it gets thicker with time so it was awful trying to get the bottles to work with daycare.  I hated all 14 days we used this product and refuse to use it again. Total nightmare.I think this may be a good product for adults but most certainly not aspirating infants.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2012"

I was pissed!!!!So I guess I'll use this at home, carefully till it's gone and will use Resource ThickenUp Clear by Nestle which can be mixed ahead of time, keeps it's consistancy and does not separate and uses 2 teaspoons for a 10 oz cup of liquid- compared to 7 teaspoons of Thick-It.

Living in the rural south, he and my mom have to drive about 3.5 hours (one way) when it is time for that prosthetic voice apparatus to  be changed out. 7 total hours of driving and heavy, traffic in a tourist city around a busy research hospital is tough. I did that drive many times for them when he was still undergoing treatments and having surgeries. He has found that the closer he gets to needing the prosthetic changed, the more he coughs when he drinks water or other thin liquids. He describes it as ""leaking"". Also, there are time when he feels that the prosthetic shifts and presses against the back of the throat causing choking. But since the visits to have the prosthetic reinstalled or adjusted are costly and not a hop, skip and jump away, he endures the discomfort. It feels to him like the prosthetic has shifted and is allowing liquid to leak into his lungs -- and as a result, convulsive coughing ensues. So I ordered this and it helps. He is still about a week and a half away from his next appointment to be refitted and the coughing is still really bad but with the thickener, its bearable. Before, he was so miserable and bitter that he was lashing out and being exceptionally negative. (He may have also been getting dehydrated which can cause mood disturbances.) He was absolutely killing my mom. That constant crossness and lashing out can really do a number on the spouse who has had to assume the role of ""caretaker"". I mean, my Dad is not disabled, but the ordeal of cancer has changed him and he depends on her more and sometimes seems to resent her ""wholeness"".Since he got this product (only 5 days ago), he and my mom (who are both retired) have taken two nice day trips to shop and eat in cities about an hour away all in the same week. All before, he had been sitting in the house day after day saying one negative thing after the other, vegging out in front of the tv and feeding off of negative news programs. Now he's out on a ""date"" with my mom and he is even talking about getting a nice room and spending the night with my mom in Charleston when they drive down for his refitting. And my dad is usually very money conscious (i.e., cheap!) so for him, this is big.No, this product may not alleviate all swallowing problems but for a person who has been suffering from a diminished quality of life due to swallowing issues, this product can be a game changer. For my dad, it gives him some power back - a tool to add to his arsenal of things he can do to help manage his condition. I think feeling helpless is where all that excessive negativity was coming from. Wish I had known about this sooner.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2019"

425,5,no_title,"I have used Thick it for several years now. Husband has upper dysphagia (a swallow disorder) Upper Dysphagia has no cure, but you can help by using this. It will help lessen events of Aspiration Pneumonia. Dysphagia can be caused by things such as stroke, Cancer of the throat and even repeat pneumonia episodes mainly in the elderly. This product can also be used with infants and small children,  however,  NEVER give a baby or small child any new changes to his diet without a Dr's order.Thick it is tasteless. Remember that it takes an adjustment period to any patient going to a  regular liquid to a thicker consistency, so keep practicing in how much you use. A little hint: Start out a bit thicker than needed. The patient will say they aren't drinking that! Then make another small amount with a little less thickness. Make sure a cold drink is really COLD! I add ice to the drink BEFORE the thick it,  stir the ice till it's mostly melted,  then scoop out the remaining ice cube ( you DON'T want them to choke!) NOW add thick it! What a person with swallowing issues desires is a refreshing cold going down the throat. I really give it a fast hard stir till powder is well dissolved. You may add a touch of lemon to water,  a little real (or artificial if diabetic) sugar to make it a little more flavorful. My husband loves ice tea. I use the above method of making it. He has to have very close to pudding thick and uses a spoon to ""eat"" it. Swallow issues state using NO straws or sports bottles. Be sure the patient can be positioned @ 30 degree angle ( NO LAYING FLAT!!) The patient can aspirate anything if they are laying down. Just practice using patient's face drinks till you get good results in thickness needed.  Thicken applesauce, soup broth, ect. I think the 2 most difficult things to thicken are milk and coffee. A person with dysphagia will have a limited diet change. Cold cereal, things like Cole slaw,  salad ( basic foods that can choke must be avoided! Have your Dr order speech therapy. Medicare will pay for 100% for IN HOME care. Use that insurance FIRST ! Many visits to the home are allowed before they stop paying! Easier on the patient to learn swallow excercises in comfort of home.  Home health is there to also help show you tips, train you and make you confident in what you're doing. By time home health care is done,  patient will understand why the excercises, ect are so important & you (Caregiver) will be able to handle this health issue like a pro.

I am able to purchase this for a couple dollars less per container locally but I like the convenience of ordering on line and having it delivered.  Locally I have to make a special trip to a particular pharmacy to purchase it. Once I place a reorder on line through Amazon, I don’t have to remember to go and buy it, it just arrives.So far the product itself is the best and most economical I’ve found.  It takes a while to thicken and seems to sometimes take longer than other times to thicken.  Most liquids, such as coffee and milk that I know I will use a consistent amount of in the next day or two, I mix up in bottles of 46-64 ozs the night before and keep in the fridge and it saves on the frustration of waiting and watching each serving to thicken. It works well in hot or cold. Seems to work exceptionally well to thicken soup bases. I will ladle a half amount of broth into soup cup or bowl and add thickener, it thickens quite fast, then I’ll add the noodles, veggies, and meat of what ever soup I’m thickening and it’s the perfect consistency every time.However, it still seems that a large amount of thickening powder is needed for everything I thicken but I have not found a better or more economical substitute so far so I continue to reorder this product.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2020"

You have to add and mix and then again and you may have to do this several times before you get the right consistency  I keep a zip lock bag of it in my handbag in case I can get him to stop for a bite to eat on the way home from the Drs.  So portability is easy.  However, my husband swears that it does not taste the same.  Now he's been told it's because his mouth is dry or his taste buds are ancient and dry and several other reasons given by nurses and doctors.

670,5,no_title,"I was forced to consume this stuff in the hospital after a tracheotomy, and I thought I'd never want to see it again! However, I eventually realized something like this could come in very handy in the kitchen. My previous go-to no-cook thickener was xanthan gum, but my son HATES when I use it in anything! This *just* thickens things, without making them stretchy or slimy or lumpy. When I pack lunches, I add it to tuna & chicken salad to thicken up the lemon juice or vinegar and help keep the bread from getting soggy; I've used it to thicken up runny store-bought jam, yogurt, and cottage cheese. I use it to replace some of the mayo in creamy salad dressings and sugar in cake frosting, thereby reducing the calories. It helps stabilize whipped cream.It is the same starch used in instant pudding mixes, so you can use it to create your own recipes (with fewer artificial flavors/colors, if desired), or turn any beverage like juice, soda, iced coffee, or flavored milk (chocolate, strawberry, Ovaltine, etc) into a pudding. Mixes & dissolves so well in hot or cold liquid! I find it more convenient than regular cornstarch, which has to be dissolved in cold liquid;  if you've already added all the ingredients to your recipe but it's looking watery, you can just stir in some Thick-It without adding more liquid as you'd have to with cornstarch. In my opinion, some thickeners like cornstarch or glucomannan dull the flavor of my food, while Thick-It either doesn't have that effect or it must be much more subtle, because I don't notice a change in flavor. I love this stuff! It is pure carbs so, being diabetic, I do have to use it sparingly, but a teaspoon or a tablespoon is usually quite enough for a recipe that makes several servings.","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2016"
